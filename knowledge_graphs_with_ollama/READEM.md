## üìù Introduction

Knowledge graphs represent information as a network of entities and relationships, providing a powerful way to organize, query, and derive insights from data. This article series and accompanying code demonstrate how to:

1. Extract structured information from unstructured text using Ollama LLMs
2. Transform these extractions into graph structures with NetworkX
3. Visualize and analyze the resulting knowledge graphs

## ‚ú® Features

- **Text to Knowledge Graph Conversion**: Transform any text document into a structured knowledge graph
- **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: Automatically identify entities and their relationships in text
- **Customizable Prompts**: Tailor the extraction process for different domains and use cases
- **Interactive Visualization**: Create insightful graph visualizations with NetworkX and Matplotlib
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that works with locally running Ollama models

## üîß Prerequisites

To run the examples in this series, you'll need:

- Python 3.8+
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI Python package (for API compatibility with Ollama)
- Ollama running locally or accessible via API

## üì¶ Installation

1. Make sure you have Ollama installed and running:
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama following instructions at https://ollama.ai/
   # Run a model (Llama 3.2 recommended)
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib openai
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Initialize the processor with default settings
processor = KnowledgeGraphProcessor(model="llama3.2")

# Process a text document
with open("sample_data/mel_gibson.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

# Extract entities and relationships, build and visualize the graph
G, json_output = processor.process_text(text, title="Mel Gibson Knowledge Graph")
```

### Custom Prompts

You can customize the system and user prompts to tailor the extraction for specific domains:

```python
processor = KnowledgeGraphProcessor(model="llama3.2")

# Set custom system prompt
processor.set_system_prompt("""You are a film industry expert. Extract entities and relationships 
related to movies, actors, directors, and film studios from the text...""")

# Set custom user prompt template
processor.set_user_prompt_template("""Extract film industry entities and relationships 
from the following text: "{text}"...""")

# Process text with custom prompts
G, json_output = processor.process_text(text)
```

### Visualization Options

The default visualization uses NetworkX with Matplotlib. You can customize the visualization by extending the `visualize_graph` method:

```python
# Customize node colors based on entity types
node_colors = {
    'person': 'skyblue',
    'film': 'lightgreen',
    'award': 'gold',
    'organization': 'lightpink'
}

# Create processor and process text
processor = KnowledgeGraphProcessor()
G, json_output = processor.process_text(text)
```

## üîÑ Process Pipeline

The knowledge graph creation process follows these steps:

1. **Text Input**: Unstructured text document is provided
2. **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: 
   - Text is sent to Ollama LLM via API
   - LLM extracts entities and relationships, returning JSON
3. **Graph Construction**:
   - JSON is parsed into NetworkX graph structure
   - Entities become nodes with type attributes
   - Relationships become directed edges with labels
4. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Graph is visualized with appropriate layouts and styling
   - Basic statistics and insights can be calculated

## üìä Example Results

When processing a biographical text about Mel Gibson, the processor extracts entities such as:
- People (Mel Gibson, George Miller)
- Films (Mad Max, Braveheart)
- Organizations (NIDA, Academy Awards)
- Locations (Peekskill, Sydney)

And relationships like:
- "starred_in" (Mel Gibson ‚Üí Mad Max)
- "directed" (Mel Gibson ‚Üí Braveheart)
- "won" (Braveheart ‚Üí Academy Award)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

1. **Ollama Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure Ollama is running locally (`ollama list` to verify)
   - Check the base URL is correct (default: http://localhost:11434/v1)

2. **JSON Parsing Errors**:
   - LLM might return malformed JSON; check raw output with debug print
   - Try adjusting temperature parameter for more consistent outputs

3. **Graph Visualization Issues**:
   - For large graphs, try different layout algorithms (spring_layout, kamada_kawai_layout)
   - Adjust node spacing with the `k` parameter in layout functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Customization

The `KnowledgeGraphProcessor` class can be extended or modified for advanced use cases:

- Implement more sophisticated graph analysis methods
- Add export functions for graph databases (Neo4j, etc.)
- Create domain-specific extraction patterns with custom prompts
- Integrate with other LLMs or services beyond Ollama
